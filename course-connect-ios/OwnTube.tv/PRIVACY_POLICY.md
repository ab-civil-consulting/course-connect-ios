## 1. What Information Does the Application Obtain?

### 1.1 User Registration Information

Registration with the Application is **optional but may be required** for certain features (such as saving watch history, playlists, and preferences).

When users choose to register, they create an account on a PeerTube instance. The following information is collected:

- Email address
- Username
- Password (encrypted and never stored by the Application itself)

**Important:** User account data is created and stored on the PeerTube instance server, not on our servers. The data retention and privacy practices of the PeerTube instance are governed by that instance's privacy policy.

### 1.2 Watch History

When you watch videos through the Application, your watch history is stored **locally on your device**. This data is not transmitted to our servers. Watch history is limited to a maximum of 50 items.

### 1.3 User Preferences

The Application stores user preferences locally on your device, including:

- Theme selection (light/dark mode)
- Playback settings (subtitles, quality preferences)
- Other display preferences

### 1.4 Analytics Data

The Application uses **PostHog** for analytics to help us understand how the app is used and improve functionality. PostHog collects:

- Playback events (play, pause, seek, completion)
- User actions (navigation, feature usage)

- Device information (OS version, app version, device type)

**Analytics Server Location:** PostHog analytics data is sent to EU-hosted servers (eu.i.posthog.com).
